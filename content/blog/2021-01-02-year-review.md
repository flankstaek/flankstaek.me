title: 2020 Year in Review
---
I did a lot less of everything than I'd have liked to in 2020, but I did manage to do some things I enjoyed and I'd like to document them. I know it's a few days late but better late than never I guess.

# Books
This is all of the books I read in 2020. I started the year finishing reading the Harry Potter series for the first time (also better late than never). I have a few cocktail/recipe books in here that I'm not sure you would exactly call "reading".

[![2020 Books](/assets/images/booksthumb.png)](/assets/images/books.png)

Of these my favorites are (in no particular order):
> * High-Rise by J.G. Ballard
> * Radicalized by Cory Doctorow
> * The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor LaValle

All three of them were books I couldn't put down and enjoyed tremendously. Additional books that I liked but didn't find *quite* as enrapturing as these three were:
> * In House in the Dark of the Woods by Laird Hunt
> * The Boatman's Daughter by Andy Davidson
> * Flowers of Mold by Ha Seong-nan
> * Mortals and Monsters by Lester del Rey

Overall I wish I had made more time for reading this year, as I fell quite behind my goal but I'm hopeful that I will be more successful this year.

# Music
Usually I record what were my favorite albums *released* in the year but this year I'd like to also note records that I discovered or particularly enjoyed for the year. I think the obsession with "new" music is detrimental to the dsicovery of music and honestly, most of the music I listen to in a year wasn't released that year so I might as well write about it.

## Released in 2020
This was a quiet year for new music to me, without shows to go to I found myself slightly less drawn to discovering new released and instead explored lots of older released.

In no order, my favorite albums from 2020 were:
> * Live Forever - Bartees Strange
> * It Is What It Is - Thundercat
> * Melee - Dogleg
> * NO DREAM - Jeff Rosenstock
> * Printer's Devil - Ratboys

Albums I discovered in 2020 that I like:
> * Lily-O - Sam Amidon
> * Time - Louis Cole
> * Somewhere City - Origami Angel
> * Worlds - Porter Robinson
> * Everything That Happens Will Happen Today - David Byrne & Brian Eno
> * The Big Freeze - Laura Stevenson

Albums that I had heard before 2020 but I especially liked this year:
> * Peripheral Vision - Turnover
> * Drunk - Thundercat
> * Weller - Weller

And as an honorable mention, these are the bands whose discographies found themselves frequently in my mind this year, and for many years prior:
> * Say Anything
> * Los Campesinos!
> * Jeff Rosentstock/Bomb the Music Industry!
> * Weatherbox
> * Motion City Soundtrack
> * Elliot Smith
> * Emperor X
> * Rozwell Kid
> * Joyce Manor
> * Motion City Soundtrack
> * Bruce Springsteen
> * Talking Heads
> * Blink 182
> * Alkaline Trio
> * My Chemical Romance
> * Baths
> * Mewithoutyou
> * The Front Bottoms
> * The Menzingers
> * Free Throw
> * Why?

And probably even more that just aren't fresh in my mind right now. Have a nice night, happy new year.
