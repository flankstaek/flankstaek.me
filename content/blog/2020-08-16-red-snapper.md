A Red Snapper cocktail is typically considered a Bloody Mary made with Gin. Originally it was just another name for a Bloody Mary but at some point the distinction between Vodka & Gin was made.


Recipe
===============================================

Red Snapper
---------------------------
> * 4 oz Tomato Juice
> * 1&frac12; oz Gin
> * &frac14; oz Lemon Juice
> * Celery Bitters
> * Hot Sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, Old Bay to taste

Execution
---------------------------
Combine all ingredients in shaker. Add ice and shake until cold. Serve in a Collins or Pint glass over ice with an Old Bay rim.

Ingredients
-------------------------
I love Old Bay alright. I think you should use it. If you don't like Old Bay, Celery Salt is great too. If you don't have or like Celery Salt, just Salt and Pepper works.

I rotate what hot sauce I am using depending on what's in my fridge but I'm partial to something with vinegar that isn't crazy spicy. Green Pepper Cholula is great, I like it 50/50 with regular Cholula. Crystal is good here too, or any local or small batch hot sauces you find enjoyable. I have a Habanero Carrot hot sauce that is delicious but on the hot side for the drink.

For Tomato Juice my preferred source is from draining cans of San Marzano tomatoes (save the tomatoes for later PLEASE). When we make sauce we don't use much of the juice so I save the excess and use it for Bloody Marys/Marias/Red Snappers.


Finished Drink
===============================================
God I love Tomato Juice. I know not everyone is totally into it. I, personally, enjoy all 3 common Bloody Mary variants pretty equally and I think there are little differences in each drinks construction. This is pretty much the same template I'd use in all three though, a little more lemon juice for a Mary, and lime juice in a Maria, but the rest stays pretty consistent. If I'm feeling particularly randy on the given morning it could be 2 oz of spirit but I typically prefer the lighter 1&frac12; oz portion.

I think the Gin in a Red Snapper comes through at just the right amount. It is not super ginny, there's just a nice touch of Juniper and you faintly get the notes of the Gin but I don't think it's overpowering. The herbal notes really lighten the drink up and make it feel a little less rich then a traditional Bloody Mary.

I don't think I should have to defend why I want to use Old Bay in the drink, but just in case there are haters out there: Old Bay is primarily Celery Salt, Paprika, Black Pepper, and Cayenne/Red Pepper. There are some other "secret" spices in there but honestly the primary ingredient here is Celery Salt which absolutely goes into a Red Snapper/Bloody Mary. If you don't like the test it's fine, but if you generally like Old Bay and have never tried it in this application I highly recommend it.
